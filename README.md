# Functional Programming and Proof in Coq Final Project: Micro-compiler

This repository contains the coq file with the solution to the Micro-compiler final project. Things to keep in mind about this project:
- All the proofs and definitions of the mandatory part were done, but the optional part was not done.
- All the code is documented to ensure that the proofs and definitions can be understood.

# Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Guido Fiorillo and Thea Li with whom I had some conversations about the project that helped me solve some problems I encountered along the way.
